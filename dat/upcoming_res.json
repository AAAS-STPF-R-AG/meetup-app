"description": "<p>Details:</p> <p>Join us on December 10th from 6:00 PM- 8:00 PM at the Ballston Techspace for snacks, drinks, and a presentation from Tim Allison- 'Relevance Tuning with Genetic Algorithms'.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>Relevance Tuning with Genetic Algorithms</p> <p>This talk builds on work by Simon Hughes and others to apply genetic algorithms (GA) and random search for finding optimal parameters for relevance ranking. While manual tuning can be useful, the parameter space is too vast to be confident that one has found optimal parameters without overfitting. We'll present Quaerite (<a href='https://github.com/mitre/quaerite' class='linkified'>https://github.com/mitre/quaerite</a>), an open source toolkit that allows users to specify experiment parameters and then run a random search and/or a GA to identify the best settings given ground truth. We'll offer an overview of mapping the Elastic parameter space to a GA problem, the importance of the baked-in n-fold cross-validation, and the surprises and successes found with deployed search systems.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:</p> <p>Tim Allison<br/>Founder/Chief Architect, Rhapsode Consulting LLC</p> <p>Tim has been working in natural language processing since 2002. In the<br/>last 5+ years, his focus has shifted to content/metadata extraction<br/>(and evaluation), advanced search and relevance tuning. Tim is a<br/>member of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the chair/VP of Apache Tika and a committer on Apache POI (2013), Apache PDFBox (2016), and Apache Lucene/Solr (2018). Tim holds a Ph.D. in Classical Studies, and in a former life, he was a professor of Latin and Greek.</p> ",

"description": "<p>Our December meetup features two speakers. Kfir Bar, chief scientist at Basis Technology, will present AI in Any Language: Using Deep Learning to Build Truly Global Named Entity Recognizer, and Chris Marciniak, a data scientist with John Snow Labs, will present An Introduction to Spark NLP.</p> <p>Doors open at 6 pm and our program starts at 6:30 pm. Thanks to WeWork Navy Yard for hosting us.</p> <p>Chris Marciniak will introduce Spark NLP, an open source library based on Apache Spark for natural language processing at scale. Spark NLP natively extends the Spark ML pipeline API's which enable zero-copy, distributed, combined NLP &amp; ML pipelines. The library also leverages Spark's built-in performance optimizations. The library implements core NLP algorithms including lemmatization, part of speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition, spell checking, and sentiment detection. The talk will demonstrate using these algorithms to build commonly used pipelines, using PySpark in Jupyter notebooks.</p> <p>Kfir Bar has spent many years working in a wide range of NLP disciplines, including statistical machine translation, named entity recognition, and digital-humanity applications. He's a big fan of combining linguistic knowledge with sophisticated AI algorithms, for extracting the most important information from a piece of text.</p> <p>His talk: Vital for medical record analysis, customer relationship management, and chatbot analytics, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key NLP component. The ability to accurately identify when entities‚Äîlike people, organizations, and locations‚Äîare mentioned in lakes of text data helps AI applications complete knowledge tasks with human-like accuracy. However, to leverage this powerful capability, challenges related to language representations, data quality, and scalability have to be overcome. Most of the existing solutions focus on English and a few other Latin-based languages. However, the linguistic diversity of human languages introduces additional challenges.</p> <p>In this talk, I will present our latest research results on NER and provide real-life examples of how we are applying these cutting-edge techniques to more than 20 different languages, including Spanish, English, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Korean, and Japanese.</p> <p>This talk focuses on practical methods for deploying deep, multilingual NLP solutions at the enterprise level. We will discuss the difference we see in accuracy, speed, and memory footprint while comparing some of the best known deep architectures, including variations of a recurrent, as well as self-attended networks.</p> ",

To get an idea of the projects we will be starting and continuing, check out projects with a status of ‚ÄúActive‚Äù, ‚ÄúLead‚Äù, and ‚ÄúScoping‚Äù on datakinddc.org.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30-7 Gathering / Food<br/>7-7:30 Welcome, introductions, and project presentations<br/>7:30-9 Work / collaborate / network<br/>9 - Clean up</p> <p>Who comes to a DataJam?<br/>You do! Anyone with an interest in using data for good is welcome! And if you‚Äôre on this page that‚Äôs you :)</p> <p>DataKind chapter leaders and core volunteers will also be in attendance.</p> <p>We need your help!<br/>DataKind believes the data science and machine learning methodologies driving innovation in the private sector can be used to advance the social good. But we need your help! We need help cleaning, analyzing, visualizing and modelling data to serve a spectrum of social missions such as reducing air inequality, expanding democracy, improving outcomes for youth in transition, and increasing access to services for homeless in DC.</p> ",
